## Kia ora 

This repo is a part of my work for the *University of Auckland* course STATS 220: Data Technologies. The course explores the processes of data acquisition, data storage and data processing using current computer technologies. 

I will use this repository to display my completed assignments as a way of keeping track of my development and for marking purposes.

## About me
I'm a long-term fan of mother nature hailing from Tāmaki Makaurau. Being raised by great sailors has influenced my love for the ocean and the natural environment. I graduated from *AUT* with Bachelor of Business in Sustainable Enterprise and Design in 2019. After working for two years as an Administration and Marketing Assistant, I decided to return to study at the *University of Auckland*. I am now in my second year studying a Bachelor of Science in GIS and Environmental Science. 

In my spare time I enjoy: 
* Crocheting 
* Sailing on my Farr 727 named *Bumble Bee*
* Sifting through second hand stores
