Edit the index.md file so that it displays the new original meme that you have created earlier using R code and the {magick} package, 
as well as the R code you used to create it.

Your index.md file needs contain information about the meme you created, for example, what the motivation was, and how your meme is new/original 
(e.g. an adaption of an existing meme format).
