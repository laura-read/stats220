# Hello Sailor
Welcome to my STATS220 assignment 1 website. 

## House of Crocs

## About my meme
I created this meme with `R` code in RStudio using the `Magick` package. I adapted an existing and popular meme format of two stacked images with accompanying text beside the images. It was inspired by three main elements: 

1. My love of sailing
2. The fact that crocs have come back into fashion
3. Lady Gaga's iconic line in the 2022 film *House of Gucci*


**Crocs and Sailing**

Crocs were in fact designed for boaties back in 2002 and are often used by sailors as they are a great waterproof shoe. However the brand is slightly controversial as it was considered ugly for many years. However, 2020 saw a rise in sales, and in the first half of 2021 Crocs brought in $1.1 billion in revenue. Which was more than the entirety of 2020. Check out this [GQ article](https://www.gq.com/story/crocs-comeback) for more information on the comeback of Crocs.

My own experience with the brand is their classic clog becoming fashionable back in 2005 very briefly, followed by a long period where owning a pair made you subject to ridicule. I am happy to once again feel confident to sing the praises of Crocs. So, my meme is a celebration of a sailor's love for Crocs. 


**Lady Gaga, an icon**

Lady Gaga played Patrizia Reggiani in the *House of Gucci* (2022) film. Where she improvised the line:
> [Father, son, and House of Gucci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLZYR03aLI0&ab_channel=LadyGagaReactions). 

Which was adored by:
* fans,
* critics, 
* and turned into many memes

### The R code used to create my House of Crocs meme:
```r

Edit the index.md file so that it displays the new original meme that you have created earlier using R code and the {magick} package, 
as well as the R code you used to create it.
