# Hello Sailor
Welcome to my STATS220 assignment 1 website. 

## About me
I'm a long-term fan of mother nature hailing from TƒÅmaki Makaurau. Being raised by great sailors has influenced my love for the ocean and the natural environment. I graduated from *AUT* with Bachelor of Business in Sustainable Enterprise and Design in 2019. After working for two years as an Administration and Marketing Assistant, I decided to return to study Environmental Science and GIS at the *University of Auckland*.

In my spare time I enjoy: 
* Crocheting 
* Sailing on my Farr 727 named *Bumble Bee*
* Sifting through second hand stores for clothes

## About my meme
I created this meme in RStudio using the Magick package. When creating this meme, I adapted an existing and popular meme format of two stacked images with accompanying text beside the images. It was inspired by three main elements: 

1. My love of sailing
2. The fact that crocs have come back into fashion
3. Lady Gaga's iconic line in the 2022 film *House of Gucci*


**Crocs and Sailing**
Crocs were in fact designed for boaties back in 2002 and are often used by sailors as they are a great waterproof shoe. However the brand is slightly controversial as it was considered ugly for many years. However, 2020 saw a rise in sales, and in the first half of 2021 Crocs brought in $1.1 billion in revenue. Which was more than the entirety of 2020. Check out this GQ article for more information on the comeback of Crocs.

My own experience with the brand is their classic clog becoming fashionable back in 2005 very briefly, followed by a long period where owning a pair made you subject to ridicule. I am happy to once again feel confident to sing the praises of Crocs. So, this meme is a celebration of a sailor's love for Crocs.

**Lady Gaga, an icon**
Lady Gaga played Patrizia Reggiani in the *House of Gucci* (2022) film. Where she improvised the line; ["father, son, and House of Gucci"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLZYR03aLI0&ab_channel=LadyGagaReactions). Which was adored by fans, critics, and turned into many memes.
